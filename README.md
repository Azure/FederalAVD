## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Core Components

#### Image Management Resources

Central storage and management for software artifacts. **Required** for custom image builds or session host customizations.

**Resources Created:**

- 🗄️ Storage Account with blob container for artifacts
- 🆔 Managed Identity with RBAC for secure access
- 🖼️ Compute Gallery for custom images
- 🔐 Private endpoints (optional, for Zero Trust)

**Learn More:**

- [Artifacts & Image Management Guide](docs/artifactsGuide.md)
- [Deploy-ImageManagement Script](docs/imageManagementScript.md)

#### Custom Image Building

Automated custom image build pipeline with artifact-based customizations.

**Features:**

- Automated software installation from artifacts
- Windows Updates and optimizations
- Supports marketplace or custom base images
- Regional image replication
- Build automation with PowerShell script

**Learn More:**

- [Image Build Guide](docs/imageBuild.md)

#### Host Pool Deployment

## 🔒 Zero Trust Security

This solution is architected to align with [Microsoft's Zero Trust principles for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/azure-infrastructure-avd):

### Security Controls

| Layer | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| **🌐 Network** | Private endpoints, no public IPs, network segmentation |
| **🔐 Identity** | Managed identities, Entra ID authentication, conditional access |
| **📁 Data** | Customer-managed keys, encryption at rest/transit, private connectivity |
| **🎯 Access** | RBAC least privilege, Azure Policy enforcement, user assignment restrictions |
| **📊 Monitoring** | Centralized logging, diagnostic data collection, threat detection |
| **⚙️ Configuration** | Immutable infrastructure, artifact-based deployment, integrity verification |

**[Zero Trust Architecture Details](docs/features.md#zero-trust-architecture)**

## 🌍 Identity Solutions

Support for multiple identity configurations to meet organizational requirements:

| Identity Solution | Description | Use Case |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Active Directory Domain Services** | Traditional hybrid identity with AD domain join | Enterprise hybrid environments with on-premises AD |
| **Entra Domain Services** | Managed domain services in Azure | Cloud-focused without on-premises AD infrastructure |
| **Entra Kerberos (Hybrid)** | Entra ID-joined hosts with AD user accounts | Modernizing while maintaining AD user accounts |
| **Entra Kerberos (Cloud-Only)** | Entra ID users with Kerberos authentication | Cloud-native with Kerberos for FSLogix |
| **Entra ID** | Pure cloud identity solution | Fully cloud-native deployments |
